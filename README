This is a repo for tiny 2D games.

They are mainly coded as a learning tool. If a real game can come out of it, the better !
Games should either be targeted to one plateform, or be somewhat portable.

There are currently 2 subdirs/plateform, all relative to NDS : 
- nds, plain libnds games.
- feos, using FeOS. http://feos.mtheall.com/
